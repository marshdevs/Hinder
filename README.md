## Project Motivation
When it comes to group based projects where the groups are expected to be formed and the project finished in a specific amount of time, such as for a Hackathon or class, finding groups can be difficult, especially if you go in alone. It can be challenging to figure out who to team up with, and, more importantly, if the skills or interests of the people you approach align with the project and goals you had in mind. Unfortunately, this often leads to settling for a group youâ€™re unsatisfied with, if for no other reason than it was the only group you could find or approach. Our team wanted to create a solution to this problem, through Hinder, a matchmaking service specifically for group projects and Hackathons. By exposing all project teams to event attendees, and vice versa, we allow teams to find members that have a skillset aligning with their needs, and a programmer can browse and match with a project that truly interests them. We hope that by acting as a middleman who introduces teams and programmers to each other, we can improve the overall experience for hackathons and other group projects.<br>
